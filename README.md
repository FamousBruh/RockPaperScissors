# RockPaperScissors
RPS Vs a somewhat intelligent computer.

Uses this paper: https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/Eyler-CMJ0909037.pdf to get statistics on the numbers behind Rock Paper Scissors, which I used for the computer to track the player's last used moves and predict their next one and counter it. This does not use machine learning as that is too specific to individuals.
